;; An implementation of the Alias Method.

;;
;; The function MAKE-DISCRETE-RANDOM-VAR takes an array of
;; probabilities and an (optional) array of values. Produces a
;; function which returns each of the values with the specified
;; probability (or the corresponding integer no values have been
;; given).
;;
;; It needs only one call to RANDOM for every value produced.
;;
;; For the licence, see at the end of the file.
